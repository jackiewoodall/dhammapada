    // Pairs
    
    1:	'All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with an evil mind, suffering (dukkha) follows him just as the wheel follows the hoof-print of the ox that draws the cart.',
    
    2:	'All mental phenomena have mind as their forerunner; they have mind as their chief; they are mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness (sukha) follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.',
    
    3:	'"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those harbouring such thoughts cannot be appeased.',
    
    4:	'"He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my belongings;"... the enmity of those not harbouring such thoughts can be appeased.',
    
    5:	'Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is an ancient Law.',
    
    6:	'People, other than the wise, do not realize, "We in this world must all die," and not realizing it continue their quarrels. The wise realize it and thereby their quarrels cease.',
    
    7:	'He who keeps his mind on pleasant objects, who is uncontrolled in his senses, immoderate in his food, and is lazy and lacking in energy, will certainly be overwhelmed by defilements (Mara), just as stormy winds uproot a weak tree.',
    
    8:	'He who keeps his mind on the impurities of the body, who is well-controlled in his senses, and is full of faith and energy, will certainly be not overwhelmed by Mara, just as stormy winds cannot shake a mountain of rock.',
    
    9:	'He who is not free from taints of moral defilements (kilesas) and yet dons the yellow robe, who lacks restraint and speaks not the truth, is unworthy of the yellow robe.',
    
    10:	'He who has discarded all moral defilements (kilesas), who is established in moral precepts, is endowed with restraint and speaks the truth, is indeed worthy of the yellow robe.',
    
    11:	'They take untruth for truth; they take truth for untruth; such persons can never arrive at the truth, for they hold wrong views.',
    
    12:	'They take truth for truth; they take untruth for untruth; such persons arrive at the truth, for they hold right views.',
    
    13:	'Just as rain penetrates a badly-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) penetrates a mind not cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana).',
    
    14:	'Just as rain cannot penetrate a well-roofed house, so also, passion (raga) cannot penetrate a mind well-cultivated in Tranquillity and Insight Development (Samatha and Vipassana).',
    
    15:	'Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves; the evil-doer grieves in both existences. He grieves and he suffers anguish when he sees the depravity of his own deeds.',
    
    16:	'Here he rejoices, hereafter he rejoices; one who performs meritorious deeds rejoices in both existences. He rejoices and greatly rejoices when he sees the purity of his own deeds.',
    
    17:	'Here he is tormented, hereafter he is tormented; the evil-doer is tormented in both existences. He is tormented, and he laments: "Evil have I done," He is even more tormented when he is reborn in one of the lower worlds (apaya).',
    
    18:	'Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy; one who performs meritorious deeds is happy in both existences. Happily he exclaims: "I have done meritorious deeds." He is happier still when he is reborn in a higher world (suggati).',
    
    19:	'Though he recites much the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but is negligent and does not practice according to the Dhamma, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others, he has no share in the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).',
    
    20:	'Though he recites only a little of the Sacred Texts (Tipitaka), but practises according to the Dhamma, eradicating passion, ill will and ignorance, clearly comprehending the Dhamma, his mind freed from moral defilements and no longer clinging to this world or to the next, he shares the benefits of the life of a bhikkhu (i.e., Magga-phala).',
    
    // Heedfulness
    
    21:	'Mindfulness is the way to the Deathless (Nibbana), unmindfulness is the way to Death. Those who are mindful do not die; those who are not mindful are as if already dead.',
    
    22: 'Fully comprehending this, the wise who are mindful, rejoice in being mindful and find delight in the domain of the Noble Ones (ariyas).',
    
    23:	'The wise, constantly cultivating Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice, being ever mindful and steadfastly striving realize Nibbana: Nibbana, which is free from the bonds of yoga; Nibbana, the Incomparable!',
    
    24:	'If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in his thought, word and deed, and if he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses, earns his living according to the Law (Dhamma), and, is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune of the mindful person steadily increase.',
    
    25:	'Through diligence, mindfulness, discipline with regard to moral precepts and control of his senses, let the man of wisdom make of himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.',
    
    26:	'The foolish and the ignorant give themselves over to negligence; whereas the wise treasure mindfulness as a precious jewel.',
    
    27:	'One should not be negligent, nor be addicted to sensual pleasures; for he who is established in mindfulness, through cultivation of Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice, experiences supreme happiness (i.e., realizes Nibbana).',
    
    28:	'The wise one dispels negligence by means of mindfulness; he ascends the tower of wisdom and being free from sorrow looks at the sorrowing beings. Just as one on the mountain top looks at those on the plain below, so also the wise one (the arahat) looks at the foolish and the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    29:	'Mindful amongst the negligent, highly vigilant amongst the drowsy, the man of wisdom advances like a race-horse, leaving the jade behind.',
    
    30:	'Through mindfulness in doing meritorious deeds Magha became king of the devas. Mindfulness is always praised, but negligence is always blamed.',
    
    31:	'A bhikkhu who takes delight in mindfulness and sees danger in negligence advances like fire, burning up all fetters. Great and small.',
    
    32:	'A bhikkhu who takes delight in mindfulness and sees danger in negligence cannot fall away; he is, indeed, very close to Nibbana.',
    
    // The Mind

    33:	'The mind is excitable and unsteady; it is difficult to control and to restrain. The wise one trains his mind to be upright as a fletcher straightens an arrow.',
    
    34:	'As a fish quivers when taken out of its watery home and thrown on to dry ground, so does the mind quiver when it is taken out of the sensual world to escape from the realm of Mara (i.e., kilesa vatta, round of moral defilements).',
    
    35:	'The mind is difficult to control; swiftly and lightly it moves and lands wherever it pleases. It is good to tame the mind, for a well-tamed mind brings happiness.',
    
    36:	'The mind is difficult to see, very delicate and subtle; it moves and lands wherever it pleases. The wise one should guard his mind, for a guarded mind brings happiness.',
    
    37:	'The mind wanders far and moves about alone; it is non-material; it lies in the cave (chamber of the heart). Those who control their mind will be free from the bonds of defilement (Mara).',
    
    38:	'If a man\'s mind is unsteady, if he is ignorant of the true Dhamma, and if his faith is wavering, then his knowledge will never be perfect.',
    
    39:	'If a man\'s mind is free from passion, if he is free from ill will, if he has abandoned both good and evil, and if he is vigilant, for such a man there is no danger.',
    
    40:	'Knowing that this body is fragile like an earthen jar, making one\'s mind secure like a fortified town, one should fight ignorance (Mara) with the weapon of knowledge. After defeating Mara one should still continue to guard one\'s mind, and feel no attachment to that which has been gained (i.e., jhana ecstasy and serenity gained through meditation).',
    
    41:	'Before long, alas! this body, deprived of consciousness, will lie on the earth, discarded like a useless log.',
    
    42:	'A thief may harm a thief; an enemy may harm an enemy; but a wrongly directed mind can do oneself far greater harm.',
    
    43:	'Not a mother, nor a father, nor any other relative can do more for the well-being of one than a rightly-directed mind can.',
    
    // Flowers
    
    44:	'Who shall examine this body, the world of Yama (i.e., the four states) and the world of man together with the world of devas? Who shall examine the well-taught Path of Virtue (Dhammapada) as an expert florist picks and chooses flowers?',
    
    45:	'The striver-on-the path shall examine this body, the world of Yama (i.e. the four states) and the world of man together with the world of devas. The striver shall examine the well-taught Path of Virtue (Dhammapada) as an expert florist picks and chooses flowers?',
    
    46:	'One who knows that this body is impermanent like froth, and comprehends that it is insubstantial as a mirage, will cut the flowers of Mara (i.e., the three kinds of rounds), and pass out of sight of the King of Death.',
    
    47:	'Like one who picks and chooses flowers, a man who has his mind attached to sensual pleasures is carried away by Death, just as a great flood sweeps away a sleeping village.',
    
    48:	'Like one who picks and chooses flowers, a man who has his mind attached to sensual pleasures and is insatiate in them is overpowered by Death.',
    
    49:	'As the bee collects nectar and flies away without damaging the flower or its colour or its scent, so also, let the bhikkhu dwell and act in the village without affecting the faith and generosity or the wealth of the villagers.',
    
    50:	'One should not consider the faults of others, nor their doing or not doing good or bad deeds. One should only consider whether one has done or not done good or bad deeds.',
    
    51:	'Just as a beautiful flower, lacking in scent, cannot give the wearer the benefit of its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha cannot benefit one who does not practice the Dhamma.',
    
    52:	'Just as a flower, beautiful as well as fragrant, will give the wearer the benefit of its scent, so also, the well-preached words of the Buddha will benefit one who practices the Dhamma.',
    
    53:	'As from a collection of flowers many a garland can be made by an expert florist, so also, much good can be done with wealth, out of faith and generosity, by one subject to birth and death.',
    
    54:	'The scent of flowers cannot go against the wind; nor the scent of sandalwood, nor of rhododendron, nor of jasmin; only the reputation of good people can go against the wind. The reputation of the virtuous ones is wafted abroad in all directions.',
    
    55:	'There are the scents of sandalwood, rhododendron, lotus and jasmin; but the scent of virtue surpasses all scents.',
    
    56:	'The scents of rhododendron and of sandalwood are very faint, but the scent (reputation) of the virtuous is the strongest; it spreads even to the abodes of the devas.',
    
    57:	'Delusion (Mara) cannot find the path taken by those who are endowed with virtue, who live mindfully, and have been freed from moral defilements by Right Knowledge.',
    
    58: 'As a sweet smelling and beautiful lotus flower may grow upon a heap of rubbish thrown on the highway, so also, out of the rubbish heap of beings may appear a disciple of the Buddha, who with his wisdom shines forth far above the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    59: 'As a sweet smelling and beautiful lotus flower may grow upon a heap of rubbish thrown on the highway, so also, out of the rubbish heap of beings may appear a disciple of the Buddha, who with his wisdom shines forth far above the ignorant worldlings.',
    
    // The Fool
    
    60: 'Long is the night to one who is wakeful; long is the journey of one league to the traveller who is tired; long is samsara (round of rebirths) to the fool who is ignorant of the true Dhamma (the Teaching of the Buddha).',
    
    61: 'If a person seeking a companion cannot find one who is better than or equal to him, let him resolutely go on alone; there can be no companionship with a fool.',
    
    62:  '"I have sons, I have wealth"; with this feeling of attachment the fool is afflicted. Indeed, he himself is not his own, how can sons and wealth be his?',
    
    63: 'The fool who knows that he is a fool can for that reason be a wise man; but the fool who thinks that he is wise is, indeed, called a fool.',
    
    64: 'A fool, even though he is associated with a wise man all his life, does not understand the Dhamma, just as a ladle does not know the taste of soup.',
    
    65: 'An intelligent man, even though he is associated with a wise man only for a moment, quickly understands the Dhamma, just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.',
    
    66: 'With themselves as their own enemies, fools lacking in intelligence move about doing evil deeds, which bear bitter fruits.',
    
    67: 'That deed is not well done if one has to repent for having done it, and if with a tearful face, one has to weep as a result of that deed.',
    
    68: 'That deed is well done if one has not to repent for having done it, and if one is delighted and happy with the result of that deed.',
    
    69: 'As long as the evil deed does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is sweet like honey; but when his evil deed does bear fruit, the fool suffers for it.',
    
    70: 'Even though, month after month, the fool living in austerity takes his food sparingly with the tip of a grass blade, he is not worth even one-sixteenth part of those who have comprehended the Truth.',
    
    71: 'An evil deed does not immediately bear fruit, just as the newly-drawn milk does not curdle at once; but it follows the fool, burning him like live coal covered with ashes.',
    
    72: 'The skill of a fool can only harm him; it destroys his merit and his wisdom.',
    
    73: 'The foolish bhikkhu desires praise for qualities he does not have, precedence among bhikkhus, authority in the monasteries, and veneration from those unrelated to him.',
    
    74: '"Let both laymen and bhikkhus think that things are done because of me; let them obey me in all matters, great and small." Such being the thoughts of the fool, his greed and his pride grow.',
    
    75: 'Indeed, the path that leads to worldly gain is one, and the Path that leads to Nibbana is another. Fully comprehending this, the bhikkhu, the disciple of the Buddha, should not take delight in worldly gain and honour, but devote himself to solitude, detachment and the realization of Nibbana.',

    // The Wise Man
    
    76: 'One should follow a man of wisdom who rebukes one for one\'s faults, as one would follow a guide to some buried treasure. To one who follows such a wise man, it will be an advantage and not a disadvantage.',
    
    77: 'The man of wisdom should admonish others; he should give advice and should prevent others from doing wrong; such a man is held dear by the good; he is disliked only by the bad.',
    
    78: 'One should not associate with bad friends nor with the vile. One should associate with good friends, and with those who are noble.',
    
    79: 'He who drinks in the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; the wise man always takes delight in the Dhamma expounded by the Noble Ones.',
    
    80: 'Farmers channel the water; fletchers straighten the arrows; carpenters work the timber; the wise tame themselves.',
    
    81: 'As a mountain of a rock is unshaken by wind, so also, the wise are unperturbed by blame or by praise.',
    
    82: 'Like a lake which is deep, clear and calm, the wise after listening to the Teaching (Dhamma) become serene.',
    
    83: 'Indeed, the virtuous give up all; the virtuous do not talk with sensual desire; when faced with joy or sorrow, the wise do not show elation or depression.',
    
    84: 'For his own sake or for the sake of others he does no evil; nor does he wish for sons and daughters or for wealth or for a kingdom by doing evil; nor does he wish for success by unfair means: such a one is indeed virtuous, wise and just.',
    
    85:	'Few among men reach the other shore (Nibbana); all the others only run up and down on this shore.',
    
    86: 'But those who practice according to the well-expounded Dhamma will reach the other shore (Nibbana), having passed the realm of Death, very difficult as it is to cross.',
    
    87: 'The man of wisdom, leaving the home of craving and having Nibbana as his goal, should give up dark, evil ways and cultivate pure, good ones. He should seek great delight in solitude, detachment and Nibbana, which an ordinary man finds so difficult to enjoy. He should also give up sensual pleasures, and clinging to nothing, should cleanse himself of all impurities of the mind.',
    
    88: 'The man of wisdom, leaving the home of craving and having Nibbana as his goal, should give up dark, evil ways and cultivate pure, good ones. He should seek great delight in solitude, detachment and Nibbana, which an ordinary man finds so difficult to enjoy. He should also give up sensual pleasures, and clinging to nothing, should cleanse himself of all impurities of the mind.',
    
    89: 'Those, with mind well-developed in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, and who have rid themselves of all craving, rejoice in their abandonment of attachment. Such men, with all moral intoxicants eradicated, and powerful with the light of Arahatta Magganana have realized Nibbana in this world.',
    
    // The Arahant
    
    90: 'For him whose journey is ended, who has destroyed all fetters, there is no more distress.',
    
    91: 'The mindful strive diligently; they take no delight in the life of sensual pleasures; like swans that forsake the muddy pool, they abandon all craving.',
    
    92: 'Arahats do not hoard anything; when taking food they reflect well over it. They have as their object liberation from existence, i.e., Nibbana which is Void and Signless. Their destination, like the course of birds in the air, cannot be traced.',
    
    93: 'The arahat is free from moral intoxicants; he is not attached to food. He has as his object Liberation from existence, i.e., Nibbana which is Void and Signless. His path, like that of birds in the air, cannot be traced.',
    
    94: 'The arahat whose sense-faculties are calm like horses well-tamed by the charioteer, who is free from pride and moral intoxicants - such an arahat is held dear even by the devas.',
    
    95: 'Like the Earth, the arahat is patient and is not provoked to respond in anger; like the doorpost he is firm; he is unperturbed by the ups and downs of life; he is serene and pure like a lake free from mud. For such an arahat there will be no more rebirth.',
    
    96: 'An arahat is calm in his mind, calm in his speech, and also in his deed; truly knowing the Dhamma, such an arahat is free from moral defilements and is unperturbed by the ups and downs of life.',
    
    97: 'He who is not credulous, who has realized the Unconditioned, who has cut off the links of the round of rebirths, who has destroyed all consequences of good and bad deeds, who has discarded all craving, is indeed the noblest of all men (i.e., as arahat).',
    
    98: 'In a village or in a forest, in a valley or on a hill, wherever the arahats dwell, that place is delightful.',

    99: 'Forests are delightful, but the worldlings find no delight in them; only those who are free from passion will find delight in them, for they do not seek sensual pleasures.',
    
    // The Thousands
    
    100: 'Better than a thousand words that are senseless and unconnected with the realization of Nibbana, is a single word of sense, if on hearing it one is calmed.',
    
    101: 'Better than a thousand verses that are senseless and unconnected with the realization of Nibbana, is a single verse, if on hearing it one is calmed.',
    
    102: 'Better than the recitation of a hundred verses that are senseless and unconnected with the realization of Nibbana, is the recitation of a single word of the teaching, if on hearing it one is calmed.',

    103: 'A man may conquer a million men in battle but one who conquers himself is, indeed, the greatest of conquerors.',
    
    104: 'It is better indeed, to conquer oneself than to conquer others. Neither a deva, nor a gandhabba, nor Mara together with Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of the man who controls himself.',
    
    105: 'It is better indeed, to conquer oneself than to conquer others. Neither a deva, nor a gandhabba, nor Mara together with Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of the man who controls himself.',

    106: 'Month after month for a hundred years, one may make offerings to ordinary people to the value of a thousand coins; yet if, only for a moment, one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has practised Insight Development, this homage is, indeed, better than a hundred years of making offerings to ordinary people.',

    107: 'For a hundred years, a man may tend the sacred fire in the forest; yet if, only for a moment, one pays homage to a bhikkhu who has practised Insight Development, this homage is, indeed, better than a hundred years of making sacrifices.',

    108: 'In this world, one may make sacrificial offerings, great and small, all the year round, in order to gain merit; all these offerings are not worth a quarter of the merit gained by worshipping the Noble Ones who walk the right path.',

    109: 'For one who always respects and honours those who are older and more virtuous, four benefits: longevity, beauty, happiness and strength, will increase.',

    110: 'Better than a hundred years in the life of an immoral person who has no control over his senses, is a day in the life of a virtuous person who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice.',

    111: 'Better than a hundred years in the life of an ignorant person who has no control over his senses, is a day in the life of a wise man who cultivates Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice.',

    112: 'Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who is idle and inactive, is a day in the life of one who makes a zealous and strenuous effort in Tranquillity and Insight Development Practice.',

    114: 'Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who does not perceive the Deathless (Nibbana), is a day in the life of one who perceives the Deathless (Nibbana).',

    115: 'Better than a hundred years in the life of a person who does not comprehend the Noble Dhamma, is a day in the life of one who comprehends the Noble Dhamma.',

    // Evil
    
    116: 'One should make haste in doing good deeds; one should restrain one\'s mind from evil; for the mind of one who is slow in doing good tends to take delight in doing evil.',

    117: 'If a man does evil, he should not do it again and again; he should not take delight in it; the accumulation of evil leads to suffering.',

    118: 'If a man does what is good, he should do it again and again; he should take delight in it; the accumulation of merit leads to happiness.',

    119: 'Even an evil person may still find happiness so long as his evil deed does not bear fruit; but when his evil deed does bear fruit he will meet with evil consequences.',

    120: 'Even a good person may still meet with suffering so long as his good deed does not bear fruit; but when it does bear fruit he will enjoy the benefits of his good deed.',

    121: 'One should not think lightly of doing evil, imagining "A little will not affect me"; just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also, the fool is filled up with evil, by accumulating it little by little.',

    122: 'One should not think lightly of doing good, imagining "A little will not affect me"; just as a water-jar is filled up by falling drops of rain, so also the wise one is filled up with merit, by accumulating it little by little.',

    123: 'Just as a wealthy merchant with few attendants avoids a dangerous road, just as one who desires to go on living avoids poison, so also, one should avoid evil.',

    124: 'If there is no wound on the hand, one may handle poison; poison does not affect one who has no wound; there can be no evil for one who has no evil intention.',

    125: 'If one wrongs a person who should not be wronged, one who is pure and is free from moral defilements, the evil falls back upon that fool, like fine dust thrown against the wind.',

    126: 'Some are reborn as human beings, the wicked are reborn in a place of continuous torment, the righteous go to the deva world, and those who are free from moral intoxicants realize Nibbana.',

    127: 'Not in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean, nor in the cave of a mountain, nor anywhere else, is there a place, where one may escape from the consequences of an evil deed.',

    128: 'Not in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean, nor in the cave of a mountain, nor anywhere else, is there a place, where one cannot be oppressed by Death.',

    // Violence
    
    129: 'All are afraid of the stick, all fear death. Putting oneself in another\'s place, one should not beat or kill others.',

    130: 'All are afraid of the stick, all hold their lives dear. Putting oneself in another\'s place, one should not beat or kill others.',

    131: 'He who seeks his own happiness by oppressing others who also desire to have happiness will not find happiness in his next existence.',

    132: 'He who seeks his own happiness by not oppressing others who also desire to have happiness will find happiness in his next existence.',

    133: 'Do not speak harshly to anyone; those who are thus spoken to will retort. Malicious talk is indeed the cause of trouble and retribution will come to you.',

    134: 'If you can keep yourself calm and quiet like a broken gong which is no longer resonant, you are sure to realize Nibbana; there will be no harshness in you.',

    135: 'As with a stick the cowherd drives his cattle to the pasture, so also, Aging and Death drive the life of beings.',

    136: 'A fool while doing evil deeds dies not know them as being evil; but that fool suffers for his evil deeds like one who is burnt by fire.',

    302: 'It is hard to become a bhikkhu; it is hard to be happy in the practice of a bhikkhu. The hard life of a householder is painful; to live with those of a different temperament is painful. A traveller in samsara is continually subject to dukkha; therefore, do not be a traveller in samsara; do not be the one to be subject to dukkha again and again.',

    303: 'He, who is full of faith and virtue, who also possesses fame and fortune, is held in reverence wherever he goes.',

    304: 'Like the Himalayas, the good are visible even from afar; like arrows shot in the night, the wicked are not seen even though they may be near.',

    305: 'He who sits alone, lies down alone, walks alone in diligent practice, and alone tames himself should find delight in living in the forest.',

    // The State of Woe
    
    306: 'One who tells lies goes into a state of woe; one who has done evil and says, "I did not do it," also goes into woe. Both of them being evil-doers, suffer alike in their next existence.',

    307: 'Many men wearing the yellow robe up to their necks who have an evil disposition and are unrestrained in thought, word and deed are reborn into a state of woe on account of their evil deeds.',

    308: 'It is better for one to eat a red-hot lump of iron burning like a flame than to eat alms-food offered by the people, if one is without morality and unrestrained in thought, word and deed.',

    309: 'Four misfortunes befall a man who is unmindful of right conduct and commits sexual misconduct with another man\'s wife: acquisition of demerit, disturbed sleep, reproach, and suffering in states of woe.',

    310: 'Thus, there is the acquisition of demerit, and there is rebirth in the evil realms. The enjoyment of a scared man with a scared woman is short-lived, and the king also metes out severe punishment. Therefore, a man should not commit sexual misconduct with another man\'s wife.',

    311: 'Just as kusa grass if badly held cuts that very hand, so also, the ill-led life of a bhikkhu drags that bhikkhu down into a state of woe.',

    312: 'An act perfunctorily performed, or a practice that is depraved, or a questionable conduct of a bhikkhu is not of much benefit.',

    313: 'If there is anything to be done, do it well; do it firmly and energetically: for the slack life of a bhikkhu scatters much dust.',

    314: 'It is better not to do an evil deed; an evil deed torments one later on. It is better to do a good deed, as one does not have to repent for having done it.',

    315: 'As a border town is guarded both inside and outside, so guard yourself. Let not the right moment go by; for those who miss this moment come to grief when they fall into a state of woe.',

    316: 'Those beings who are ashamed of what should not be ashamed of, who are not ashamed of what should be ashamed of, and who hold wrong views, go towards a state of woe.',

    317: 'Those beings who see danger in what is not dangerous, who do not see danger in what is dangerous, and who hold wrong views, go towards a state of woe.',

    318: 'Beings who imagine wrong in what is not wrong, who do not see wrong in what is wrong, and who hold wrong views, go into a state of woe.',

    319: 'Beings who know what is wrong as wrong, who know what is right as right, and who hold right views, go into a state of happiness.',
    
    // The Elephant
    
    320: 'As an elephant in battlefield withstands the arrow shot from a bow, so shall I endure abuse. Indeed, many people are without morality.',

    321: 'Only the trained horses and elephants are led to gatherings of people; the king mounts only the trained horses and elephants. Noblest among men are the tamed, who endure abuse.',

    322: 'Mules, thoroughbred horses, horses from Sindh, and great elephants are noble only when they are trained; but one who has tamed himself is far nobler.',

    323: 'Indeed, not by any means of transport can one go to the place one has never been before; but by thoroughly taming oneself, the tamed one can get to that place.',

    324: 'The elephant called Dhanapala, in severe must and uncontrollable, being in captivity, eats not a morsel, yearning for his native forest.',

    325: 'The stupid one, who is lazy, gluttonous, and drowsy, who just wallows like a well-fed pig, is subject to repeated rebirths.',

    326: 'In the past, this mind has wandered as it liked, wherever it liked, at its own pleasure. Now I will control my mind wisely, as a mahout with his goad controls an elephant in must.',

    327: 'Take delight in mindfulness, guard your mind well. As an elephant stuck in mire pulls itself out, so also, pull yourself out of the mire of moral defilements.',

    328: 'If one finds a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live with him joyfully and mindfully, overcoming all dangers.',

    329: 'If one cannot find a sagacious friend, who is a virtuous and steadfast companion, one should live alone like the king who gave up and left the country he had won, and like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.',

    330: 'It is better to live alone; there is no fellowship with a fool. So one should live alone, do no evil, and be carefree like the elephant Matanga roaming alone in the forest.',

    331: 'It is good to have friends when the need arises; it is good to be content with anything that is available; it is good to have merit when life is about to end: it is good to be rid of all suffering.',

    332: 'In this world it is good to be dutiful to one\'s mother; also it is good to be dutiful to one\'s father. In this world also it is good to minister unto recluses; also, it is good to minister unto the Wise.',

    333: 'It is good to have virtue till old age, it is good to have unshakeable faith, it is good to gain wisdom, it is good to do no evil.',

    // Craving
    
    334: 'In a man who is unmindful craving grows like a creeper. He runs from birth to birth, like a monkey seeking fruits in the forest.',

    335: 'In this world, sorrow grows in one who is overwhelmed by this vile craving that clings to the senses, just as well-watered birana grass grows luxuriantly.',

    336: 'In this world, sorrow falls away from one who overcome this vile craving that is difficult to get rid of, just as water-drops fall away from a lotus leaf.',

    337: 'Therefore, I will deliver this worthy discourse to all of you who have assembled here. Dig up the root of craving just as one who wishes to have the fragrant root digs up the birana grass. Do not let Mara destroy you again and again, as the flood destroys the reed.',

    338: 'Just as a tree with roots undamaged and firm grows again even though cut down, so also, if latent craving is not rooted out, this dukkha arises again and again.',

    339: 'That man of wrong views, in whom the thirty-six streams (of craving) that flow towards pleasurable objects are strong, is carried away by his many thoughts connected with passion.',

    340: 'The stream of craving flows towards all sense objects; the creeper of craving arises at the six sense-doors and fixes itself on the six sense objects. Seeing that creeper of craving growing, cut off its roots with Insight Knowledge.',

    341: 'In beings, there flows happiness that is smeared with craving; those beings attached to pleasure and seeking pleasure are, indeed, subject to birth and ageing.',

    342: 'People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare; held fast by fetters and bonds they undergo dukkha again and again, for a long time.',

    343: 'People beset with craving are terrified like a hare caught in a snare. Therefore, one who wishes to free himself from craving should eradicate craving.',

    344: 'Having left the forest of desire, he takes to the forest of the practice; but when he is free from the forest of desire he rushes back to that very forest. Come, look at that man who having become free rushes back into that very bondage.',

    345: 'The wise do not say that bonds made of iron, of wood and of hemp are strong bonds; they say that only passionate attachment to and care for gems and jewelry, children and wives are strong bonds. These drag one down and, although they seem yielding, are difficult to unfasten. The wise, cutting off this bond of craving and resolutely giving up sensual pleasures, renounce the world.',

    346: 'The wise do not say that bonds made of iron, of wood and of hemp are strong bonds; they say that only passionate attachment to and care for gems and jewelry, children and wives are strong bonds. These drag one down and, although they seem yielding, are difficult to unfasten. The wise, cutting off this bond of craving and resolutely giving up sensual pleasures, renounce the world.',
    
    347: 'Beings who are infatuated with lust fall back into the Stream of Craving they have generated, just as a spider dies in the web it has spun. The wise, cutting off the bond of craving, walk on resolutely, leaving all ills behind.',

    348: 'Give up the past, give up the future, give up the present. Having reached the end of existences, with a mind freed from all conditioned things, you will not again undergo birth and decay.',

    349: 'In a man who is disturbed by (sensual) thoughts, whose passions are strong, and who keeps seeing objects as being pleasant, craving grows more and more. Indeed, he makes his bondage strong.',

    350: 'A man who takes delight in calming thoughts, who is ever mindful, and meditates on the impurities will certainly get rid of craving; this man will cut the bond of Mara.',

    351: 'He who has attained arahatship is free from fear, free from craving, and free from moral defilements. He has cut off the thorns of existence. This is the last existence.',

    352: 'He who is free from craving, and from attachment, who is skilled in the knowledge of the significance of terms, who knows the grouping of letters and their sequence is indeed called "one who has lived his last, a man of great wisdom, a great man".',

    353: 'I have overcome all, I know all, I am detached from all, I have given up all; I am liberated from moral defilements having eradicated Craving. Having comprehended the Four Noble Truths by myself, whom should I point out as my teacher?',

    354: 'The gift of the Dhamma excels all gifts; the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes; delight in the Dhamma excels all delights. The eradication of Craving overcomes all ills.',

    355: 'Wealth destroys the foolish; but it cannot destroy those who seek the other shore. By his craving for wealth the fool destroys himself, as he would destroy others.',

    356: 'Weeds damage fields; lust spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from lust yields great benefit.',

    357: 'Weeds damage fields; ill will spoil all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from ill will yield great benefit.',

    358: 'Weeds damage fields; ignorance spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from ignorance yields great benefit.',

    359: 'Weeds damage fields; covetousness spoils all beings. Therefore, giving to those free from covetousness yields great benefit.',

    // The Monk
    
    360: 'Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear; restraint in the nose is good, good is restraint in the tongue.',

    361: 'Restraint in the body is good, good is restraint in speech; restraint in mind is good, good is restraint in all the senses. A bhikkhu restrained in all the senses is greed from all ills.',
    
    362: 'He who controls his hand, controls his foot, controls his speech, and has complete control of himself; who finds delight in Insight Development Practice and is calm; who stays alone and is contented; - him they call a bhikkhu.',

    363: 'The bhikkhu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely with his mind composed, who explains the meaning and the text of the Dhamma; - sweet are the words of that bhikkhu.',

    365: 'One should not despise what one has received, nor should one envy others their gains. The bhikkhu who envies others cannot attain concentration.',

    366: 'Though he receives only a little, if a bhikkhu does not despise what he has received, the devas will surely praise him who leads a pure life and is not slothful.',

    367: 'He who does not take the mind-and-body aggregate as "I and mine", and who does not grieve over the dissolution is, indeed, called a bhikkhu.',

    368: 'The bhikkhu, who lives exercising loving-kindness and is devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha, will reakize Nibbana - the Tranquil, the Unconditioned, the Blissful.',

    369: 'O Bhikkhu, bale out the water of wrong thoughts from this boat (your body); when empty it will sail swiftly; having cut off passion and ill will you will realize Nibbana.',

    370: 'Cut off the five lower fetters; give up the five upper fetters; and develop the five controlling faclities. The bhikkhu who has freed himself of the five bonds (passion, ill will, ignorance, pride and wrong view) is called "One who has crossed the flood".',

    371: 'O Bhikkhu, meditate, and do not be unmindful; do not let your mind rejoice in sensual pleasures. Do not be unmindful and swallow the hot lump of iron; as you burn, do not cry, "This, indeed, is suffering".',

    372: 'There can be no concentration in one who lacks wisdom; there can be no wisdom in one who lacks concentration. He who has concentration as well as wisdom is, indeed, close to Nibbana.',

    373: 'The bhikkhu who goes into seclusion to meditate, whose mind is tranquil, who clearly perceives the Dhamma, experiences the joy which transcends that of ordinary men.',

    374: 'Every time he clearly comprehends the arising and the perishing of the aggregates, he finds joy and rapture. That, to the wise, is the way to Nibbana.',

    375: 'For a wise bhikkhu in this Teaching, this is the beginning of the practice leading to Nibbana: control of the senses, contentment, and restraint according to the Fundamental Precepts.',

    376: 'Associate with good friends, who are energetic and whose livelihood is pure; let him be amiable and be correct in his conduct. Then, feeling much joy he will make an end of dukkha.',

    377: 'O Bhikkhus! As the jasmin plant sheds its withered flowers, so also, should you shed passion and ill will.',

    378: 'The bhikkhu who is calm in body, calm in speech, calm in mind, who is well-composed and has given up worldly pleasures, is called a "Tranquil One".',

    379: 'O Bhikkhu, by yourself, exhort yourself, and examine yourself; thus guarding yourself and being mindful, you will live in peace.',

    380: 'One indeed is one\'s own refuge, how could anyone else be one\'s refuge? One indeed is one\'s own haven; therefore, look after yourself as a horse dealer looks after a thoroughbred.',

    381: 'The bhikkhu who frequently feels joy and is devoted to the Teaching of the Buddha will realize Nibbana - the Tranquil, the Unconditioned, the Blissful.',

    382: 'A bhikkhu who, though young, devotes himself to the Teaching of the Buddha lights up the world, as does the moon freed from a cloud.',
    
    // The Holy Man

    384: 'When the holy man is well-established in the two dhammas (i.e., the practice of Tranquillity and Insight Meditation), then, in that knowing one, all fetters are destroyed.',

    385: 'Him I call a holy man, who has for him neither this shore (i.e., the sense bases) nor the other shore (i.e., the sense objects), and who is undistressed and free from moral defilements.',

    386: 'Him I call a holy man who dwells in seclusion practicing Tranquillity and Insight Meditation and is free from taints of moral defilements, who has performed his duties and is free from moral intoxicants and has reached the highest goal.',

    387: 'By day shines the sun; by night shines the moon; in regalia the king; in meditation shines the arahat; but the Buddha in his glory shines at all times, by day and by night.',

    388: 'Because he has discarded evil he is called a "holy man"; because he lives calmly he is called a "recluse"; and because he gets rid of his impurities he is called a "renunciate".',

    389: 'One should not strike a holy man; a holy man should not get angry with his assailant; it is shameful to strike, a holy man; it is more shameful to get angry with one\'s assailant.',

    390: 'For a holy man there is no benefit at all, if he does not restrain from anger to which his mind is prone. In as much as the intention to harm is desisted, to that extent dukkha ceases.',

    391: 'Him I call a holy man who does not evil indeed or word or thought, who is restrained in these three respects.',

    392: 'If from somebody one should learn the Teaching of the Buddha, he should respectfully pay homage to that teacher, as a brahmin worships the sacrificial fire.',

    393: 'Not by wearing matted hair, nor by lineage, nor by caste, does one become a holy man; only he who realize the truth and the Dhamma is pure; he is a holy man.',

    394: 'O foolish one! What is the use if your wearing matted hair? What is the use of your wearing garment made of antelope skin? In you, there is a forest of moral defilements; you clean yourself only externally.',

    395: 'Him I call a holy man, who wears robes made from rags, who is lean with veins standing out, who meditates alone in the forest.',

    396: 'I do not call him a holy man just because he is born from the womb of a highborn mother. He is just a bhovadi brahmin if he is not free from moral defilements. Him I call a holy man, who is free from moral defilements and attachment.',

    397: 'Him I call a holy man, who has cut off all fetters and is fearless, who is beyond attachment and is free from moral defilements.',

    398: 'Him I call a holy man, who has cut the strap of ill will, the thong of craving, and the cord of wrong views, who has lifted the bar that fastens the door of ignorance, and who knows the Truth.',

    399: 'Him I call a holy man, who, without anger, endures abuse, beating and being bound, to whom the strength of patience is like the strength of any army.',

    400: 'Him I call a holy man, who is free from anger, who practices austerity, who is virtuous and free from craving, who is controlled in his senses and for whom this body is the very last.',

    405: 'Him I call a holy man who has laid aside the use of force towards all beings, the perturbed as well as the unperturbed, and who does not kill or cause others to kill.',

    406: 'Him I call a holy man who is not hostile to those who are hostile, who is peaceful to those with weapons, and who is without attachment to objects of attachment.',

    407: 'Him I call a holy man, from whom passion, ill will, pride and detraction have fallen off, like a mustard seed from the tip of an awl.',
